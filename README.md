## 🚀 About Me

I’m a passionate and results-driven Data Scientist and ML Engineer with **3+ years of professional experience** designing, developing, and deploying Machine Learning models and data-driven solutions. My work bridges the gap between data research, production-ready systems, and business impact.

I enjoy tackling complex problems involving **time series forecasting, anomaly detection, NLP, classic and deep learning models**, and building stable APIs to serve models in real-world environments.

## 💼 Professional Experience

### **Data Scientist**  
**FGUP Glavnivts of the Presidential Directorate of the Russian Federation**  
*Sep 2023 – Present* • Moscow, Russia

- Worked with large datasets on classic ML tasks: EDA, classification, regression, clustering, distribution analysis.
- Researched and benchmarked different modeling techniques to improve model accuracy.
- Integrated new data sources into modeling pipelines alongside analytics teams.
- Designed and deployed **end-to-end ML pipelines** using sklearn, PyTorch, CatBoost, and Darts.
- Applied **SHAP** for model interpretation and business insights.
- Built **FastAPI/Pydantic REST APIs** for automatic model inference, logging, and status tracking with PostgreSQL.
- Developed modules for **time series forecasting, imputation, and anomaly detection**.
- Combined multiple methods (ARIMA, Kalman filters, STL, TBATS, Auto-ML, and LLMs for time series) to improve detection quality and speed.
- Performed **geospatial data analysis with GeoPandas**.

> **Key outcomes:**  
> + Improved classification accuracy by 7%+  
> + Increased anomaly detection coverage by 70% and accuracy by 20%
